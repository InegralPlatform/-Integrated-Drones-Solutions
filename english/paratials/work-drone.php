                <p class="heading_txt text-center">Drones are basically remote-controlled devices, that have the capability to fly using the provided rotors, and which can be controlled wirelessly using a wireless transmitter. Drones are usually toys, but these days their applications range from photography to surveillance to monitoring and managing crops etc. Most drones these days are usually made of materials like hard plastics but in some expensive models, carbon fibre and titanium are also used. </p>
